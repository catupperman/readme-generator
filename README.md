## Description of Project
> This project was taking node, downloading json packages, and utilizing information from those packages.  This is a very similar style to using APIs.  Finding the package that is applicable for your application is always a challenge.  Once understanding that inquirer would be the best fit, calling it with the require method, resulted in a response driven README generated within the terminal.
## Installation
> I pulled the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package aka ```package.json```, entering ```npm install``` , and then the ```require``` method to narrow down to the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package.
## Methods Used
> * node * ```fs.writeFile```  promises  * inquirer package * [Shields IO](https://shields.io/category/license) *[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) 
## Contributions
> undefined
## Testing Process
> In order to ensure, all aspects of the application were working properly, I would continuously check each step of the way to make sure no error appeared.  I simply entered ```node index.js``` , then followed the prompts of questions within the terminal to make sure, each one (yes, all the questions on the page) showed within the README, and showed up well. For minimal aesthetic clean up, I would go within the README file, and make adjustments.
